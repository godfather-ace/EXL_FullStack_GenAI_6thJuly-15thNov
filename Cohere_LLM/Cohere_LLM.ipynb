      "Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and language models. They were introduced in a groundbreaking paper called \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers use a mechanism called \"self-attention\" to process input sequences, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies in data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key idea is to enable the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when processing it, which is particularly useful for understanding context and generating coherent text. Transformer models have become the foundation for many state-of-the-art LLMs due to their ability to handle long sequences and parallel processing, making them highly efficient and effective in various language-related tasks.\n"
